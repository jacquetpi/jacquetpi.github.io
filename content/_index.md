I am interested in the environmental footprint of cloud computing and how system engineering can reduce it, developing methods that help providers accommodate diverse usage at scale.
I currently focus on sharing mechanisms through orchestration and oversubscription.

Questions about real cloud platform challenges? Interested in collaborating? Contact: pierre.{lastname} {at} etsmtl {dot} ca
